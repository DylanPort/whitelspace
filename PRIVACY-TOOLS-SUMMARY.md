```

- Top 3 by score reviewed by you
- Check quality, originality, usefulness
- Select winner
- Send 500 USDC/SOL to creator_wallet
- Feature on homepage

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

**What's Protected:**
- ✅ API keys never exposed to frontend
- ✅ All AI calls go through Netlify Functions
- ✅ Tools run in Val.town sandbox (not your server)
- ✅ Iframe sandbox for tool preview
- ✅ Approval workflow prevents malicious tools
- ✅ RLS in Supabase prevents unauthorized data access

**Best Practices:**
- ⚠️ Review all tools before approving
- ⚠️ Check generated code for suspicious patterns
- ⚠️ Test tools in sandbox before approval
- ⚠️ Monitor OpenAI costs (set spending limits)
- ⚠️ Add rate limiting for tool creation
- ⚠️ Consider requiring wallet connection

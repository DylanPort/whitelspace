## 💬 FAQ Soundbites

**Q: How is this different from Signal?**
A: Signal is centralized (controlled by one company). Whistle is decentralized (community-run nodes), includes AI tools, privacy utilities, and Web3 integration.

**Q: Is my data really private?**
A: Yes. Our AI runs in your browser (data never sent to servers), communication is end-to-end encrypted, and we can't access your data even if we wanted to. It's open source—verify it yourself.

**Q: Why Solana?**
A: Fast, cheap transactions perfect for micropayments. Our $WHISTLE token and staking mechanism reward node operators who support the network.

**Q: Is it free?**
A: Core features are free. Premium features use x402 micropayments (pay-per-use, no subscriptions).

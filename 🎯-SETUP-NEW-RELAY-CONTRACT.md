## üöÄ **SETUP STEPS:**

### **Step 1: Initialize Pool** ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED

```bash
# Open in browser:
file:///C:/Users/salva/Downloads/Encrypto/init-relay-pool.html

  - Total relay requests: 0

**Expected output:**
```
‚úÖ Pool initialized successfully!
Pool PDA: [calculated address]
Transaction: [signature]
```

---

### **Step 2: Create Pool Vault** ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED

```bash
# Open in browser:
file:///C:/Users/salva/Downloads/Encrypto/create-relay-vault.html

# Or double-click:
create-relay-vault.html
```

**What it does:**
- Creates Associated Token Account for pool
- This holds all staked $WHISTLE tokens
- Required for staking and relay fees

**Expected output:**
```
‚úÖ Pool vault created successfully!
Pool Vault: [ATA address]
Transaction: [signature]
```

---

### **Step 3: Test Staking** ‚úÖ VERIFY

```bash
# 1. Hard refresh browser
Ctrl+Shift+R

# 2. Navigate to Ghost Whistle
http://localhost:3000

### **Step 4: Test Relay Creation** üÜï NEW FEATURE

```bash
# 1. Scroll to "üîí Anonymous Relay Service"

# 2. Fill form:
Recipient: [Valid Solana address]
Amount: 0.01 SOL
Token: SOL
Privacy: 5 hops (25 $WHISTLE)

# 3. Click "Sign & Create Relay"
```

**What happens:**
- ‚úÖ Validates inputs
- ‚úÖ Signs transaction offline
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Calls `create_relay_request` on contract
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Transfers 25 $WHISTLE to escrow
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Creates `RelayRequest` account on-chain
- ‚úÖ Appears in relay history

---

## üìä **WHAT'S NEW:**

### **On-Chain Relay Tracking:**
```
Before: Relay requests stored locally only
After: Relay requests stored on-chain ‚úÖ

Benefits:
- Trustless escrow
- Verifiable relay completion
- Automatic payment distribution
- On-chain proof of relay
```

### **Fee Collection:**
```
Before: No fees collected
After: Fees escrowed in pool vault ‚úÖ

Flow:
User creates relay
  ‚Üì
25 $WHISTLE transferred to pool vault
  ‚Üì
Nodes relay transaction
  ‚Üì
Each node claims their share
  ‚Üì
Payment distributed based on reputation
```

### **Node Rewards:**
```
Before: Nodes volunteer (no payment)
After: Nodes earn $WHISTLE for relays ‚úÖ

Example (5-hop relay, 25 $WHISTLE fee):
- Base payment: 5 $WHISTLE per node
- Reputation bonus: Up to 50% extra
- High reputation node: 7.5 $WHISTLE
- Low reputation node: 5 $WHISTLE
```

---

## üîç **VERIFY SETUP:**

### **Check Pool Initialized:**
```javascript
// In browser console (F12):
const connection = new solanaWeb3.Connection(
  'https://rpc-mainnet.solanatracker.io/?api_key=25ef537d-3249-479c-96cb-40efc0ce3e09',
  'confirmed'
);

const programId = new solanaWeb3.PublicKey('3pb437ujFvPq6bKEUnoEwBc711ehM2h9vMu9QkNDsxFN');
const [poolPDA] = await solanaWeb3.PublicKey.findProgramAddress(
  [Buffer.from('pool')],
  programId
);

const poolAccount = await connection.getAccountInfo(poolPDA);
console.log('Pool exists:', poolAccount !== null);
console.log('Pool PDA:', poolPDA.toString());
```

### **Check Pool Vault Created:**
```javascript
const whistleMint = new solanaWeb3.PublicKey('6Hb2xgEhyN9iVVH3cgSxYjfN774ExzgiCftwiWdjpump');
const tokenProgramId = new solanaWeb3.PublicKey('TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA');
const associatedTokenProgramId = new solanaWeb3.PublicKey('ATokenGPvbdGVxr1b2hvZbsiqW5xWH25efTNsLJA8knL');

const [poolVaultPDA] = await solanaWeb3.PublicKey.findProgramAddress(
  [
    poolPDA.toBuffer(),
    tokenProgramId.toBuffer(),
    whistleMint.toBuffer()
  ],
  associatedTokenProgramId
);

const vaultAccount = await connection.getAccountInfo(poolVaultPDA);
console.log('Vault exists:', vaultAccount !== null);
console.log('Vault PDA:', poolVaultPDA.toString());
```

---

## üêõ **TROUBLESHOOTING:**

### **"Pool not initialized"**
```
Solution: Run init-relay-pool.html first
```

### **"Vault not found"**
```
Solution: Run create-relay-vault.html after initializing pool
```

### **"Insufficient funds" when creating relay**
```
Check:
1. Do you have enough $WHISTLE for fee? (15/25/50)
2. Do you have enough SOL for tx? (~0.001)
3. Is your balance displaying correctly?
```

### **"Account not found" when staking**
```
Solution: Make sure vault is created
Run: create-relay-vault.html
```

### **Relay doesn't appear in history**
```
Check:
1. Transaction confirmed?
2. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check console for errors (F12)
```

---

## üìà **EXPECTED FLOW:**

### **User Creates Relay:**
```
1. User fills form (recipient, amount, privacy level)
2. Clicks "Sign & Create Relay"

5. Smart contract:
   - Validates inputs (min 3 hops, min fee)
   - Transfers fee to pool vault (escrow)
   - Creates RelayRequest account
   - Sets status: Pending
6. Relay appears in history
7. Nodes can now join this relay
```

### **Node Joins Relay:**
```
1. Node sees relay request
2. Node calls join_relay()
3. Smart contract:
   - Checks node is staked (10k $WHISTLE)
   - Adds node to participants
   - Updates status: InProgress
4. Node prepares to relay transaction
```

### **Relay Completes:**
```
1. Final node broadcasts to Solana
2. Transaction confirms
3. Node calls complete_relay()
4. Smart contract:
   - Validates all nodes joined
   - Sets status: Completed
   - Records transaction hash
5. Nodes can now claim payment
```

### **Node Claims Payment:**
```
1. Node calls claim_relay_payment()
2. Smart contract:
   - Calculates base payment (fee √∑ nodes)
   - Calculates reputation bonus (up to 50%)
   - Transfers $WHISTLE to node
   - Updates node stats
   - Updates reputation
3. Node receives payment
4. Reputation increases

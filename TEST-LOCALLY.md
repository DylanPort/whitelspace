# üß™ How to Test Ghost Whistle Desktop Locally

## Quick Overview

You need to test 2 things:
1. **Website download button** ‚Üí Opens download page correctly
2. **Desktop software** ‚Üí Runs and works properly

---

## Part 1: Test the Website Download Button

### Option A: Using Existing Local Server

If your local server is already running:

```bash
# If server.js is running on port 8080
# Just open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:8080/

# Navigate to Ghost Whistle section
# Click "Download Desktop" button
# Should open: http://localhost:8080/download-desktop.html
```

### Option B: Start Fresh Local Server

```bash
# In your main project directory (Encrypto)
node server.js

# Then open browser:
http://localhost:8080/
```

### What to Check:
- ‚úÖ Download button appears in Ghost Whistle section
- ‚úÖ Clicking it opens `download-desktop.html`
- ‚úÖ Download page shows all 3 platforms (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- ‚úÖ Clicking each platform shows build instructions
- ‚úÖ Modal opens and closes correctly

---

## Part 2: Test the Desktop Software

### Quick Test (Development Mode)

**Best for testing - no building required!**

```bash
# 1. Navigate to desktop project
cd ghost-whistle-desktop

# 2. Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# 3. Run in development mode
npm run dev
```

**What happens:**
- Electron window opens immediately
- App runs without building executable
- Hot reload for quick testing
- Console shows debug output

### What to Test in Dev Mode:

#### Test 1: Window Opens
- ‚úÖ App window appears
- ‚úÖ Shows "Ghost Whistle Desktop" title
- ‚úÖ Dashboard is visible
- ‚úÖ Settings button works

#### Test 2: Settings
1. Click "Settings" button
2. Enter a test wallet address (any Solana address)
3. Toggle auto-start, minimize, notifications
4. Click "Save Settings"
5. Go back to Dashboard
6. Settings should persist

#### Test 3: Node Operations
1. Make sure settings have a wallet address
2. Click "START NODE" button
3. Watch for:
   - ‚úÖ Status changes to "ACTIVE & EARNING" üü¢
   - ‚úÖ Uptime counter starts
   - ‚úÖ Stats update in real-time
4. Click "STOP NODE"
5. Status should go back to OFFLINE

#### Test 4: System Tray
1. Minimize the window (close button)
2. ‚úÖ App should minimize to system tray (not quit)
3. Look for tray icon in:
   - **Windows**: System tray (bottom right)
   - **macOS**: Menu bar (top right)
   - **Linux**: System tray area
4. Right-click tray icon
5. ‚úÖ Context menu appears
6. Click "Show Dashboard"
7. ‚úÖ Window reopens

#### Test 5: Console Logs

In the terminal where you ran `npm run dev`, watch for:

```
üëª Ghost Whistle Node Server initialized
Waiting for commands from main process...
üöÄ Starting Ghost Whistle Node...
üì° Connecting to signaling server...
‚úÖ Connected to signaling server
üìù Registration sent to server
‚úÖ Node started successfully
```

## Part 3: Test the Built Executable (Full Test)

**Only if you want to test the final user experience:**

### Build for Your Platform

```bash
# In ghost-whistle-desktop directory

# Windows
npm run build:win

# macOS  
npm run build:mac

# Linux
npm run build:linux
```

### Where to Find It:
```
ghost-whistle-desktop/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dist/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Ghost Whistle Desktop Setup 1.0.0.exe  (Windows)
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Ghost Whistle Desktop-1.0.0.dmg        (macOS)
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Ghost Whistle Desktop-1.0.0.AppImage   (Linux)
```

### Install and Test:

**Windows:**
```bash
# Run the installer
cd dist
start "Ghost Whistle Desktop Setup 1.0.0.exe"

# Or use portable version
start "Ghost Whistle Desktop 1.0.0.exe"
```

**macOS:**
```bash
# Open the DMG
open "dist/Ghost Whistle Desktop-1.0.0.dmg"
# Drag to Applications folder
# Launch from Applications
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x "dist/Ghost Whistle Desktop-1.0.0.AppImage"

# Run it
./"dist/Ghost Whistle Desktop-1.0.0.AppImage"
```

---

## Part 4: Test Network Connectivity

### Check Connection to Production Server

While the app is running:

1. **Check Console Output:**
```
‚úÖ Connected to signaling server
‚úÖ Node registered successfully
```

2. **Check in Browser:**
   - Open: https://whitelspace.onrender.com/health
   - Should show active nodes count
   - Your node should be included

3. **Check Stats in App:**
   - Wait 30 seconds
   - Stats should start updating
   - If relays happen, count increases

### If Node Won't Connect:

**Check 1: Internet Connection**
```bash
# Test connection to server
ping whitelspace.onrender.com

# Or use curl
curl https://whitelspace.onrender.com/health
```

**Check 2: Firewall**
- Windows Defender might block it
- Allow through firewall if prompted

**Check 3: Wallet Address**
- Make sure you entered a valid Solana address
- Format: Base58 string, ~44 characters

## Part 5: Quick Test Script

**I'll create a test script for you:**

### Windows Test Script

```batch
@echo off
echo.
echo ====================================
echo   Ghost Whistle - Local Testing
echo ====================================
echo.

echo [1/3] Testing website...
start http://localhost:8080/
echo Open browser and click Download Desktop button
echo.

echo [2/3] Starting desktop app in dev mode...
cd ghost-whistle-desktop
echo Installing dependencies...
call npm install --silent
echo.
echo Starting app...
call npm run dev
echo.

pause
```

### Linux/Mac Test Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo ""
echo "===================================="
echo "   Ghost Whistle - Local Testing"
echo "===================================="
echo ""

echo "[1/3] Testing website..."
open http://localhost:8080/  # macOS
# xdg-open http://localhost:8080/  # Linux
echo "Open browser and click Download Desktop button"
echo ""

echo "[2/3] Starting desktop app in dev mode..."
cd ghost-whistle-desktop
echo "Installing dependencies..."
npm install
echo ""
echo "Starting app..."
npm run dev
```

# Pre-Audit Checklist - Ghost Whistle Staking Contract

## 📋 Complete Before Submitting to Auditors

---

## ✅ Code Quality

### **Compilation & Warnings:**
- [ ] Contract compiles without errors
- [ ] No Clippy warnings (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`)
- [ ] No unused imports or dead code
- [ ] All `TODO` comments resolved
- [ ] Anchor version pinned (v0.29.0)

### **Code Style:**
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Functions < 50 lines (complex logic split)
- [ ] All public functions documented
- [ ] Error messages are descriptive
- [ ] Magic numbers replaced with constants

**Commands:**
```bash
cd audit-prep
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo build --release
```

---

## 📝 Documentation

### **Code Comments:**
- [ ] All structs have doc comments (`///`)
- [ ] All instructions explained
- [ ] Complex logic has inline comments
- [ ] Security assumptions documented
- [ ] Known limitations noted

### **External Documentation:**
- [x] README.md created
- [x] SECURITY.md created
- [x] ARCHITECTURE.md created
- [ ] API documentation generated (`cargo doc`)
- [ ] Deployment guide included

**Generate Docs:**
```bash
cargo doc --no-deps --open
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### **Unit Tests:**
- [ ] All instructions have tests
- [ ] All error codes tested
- [ ] Edge cases covered (overflow, underflow, zero values)
- [ ] PDA derivation tested
- [ ] Authorization tests (unauthorized calls fail)

### **Integration Tests:**
- [ ] Full user journey tested (stake → relay → claim)
- [ ] Multi-user interactions tested
- [ ] Concurrent operations tested
- [ ] Fee distribution accuracy validated

### **Test Coverage:**
- [ ] Target: 90%+ code coverage
- [ ] All branches tested
- [ ] All error paths tested

**Run Tests:**
```bash
anchor test
cargo test

# Coverage (requires tarpaulin)
cargo tarpaulin --out Html
```

**Current Status:** ⚠️ ~40% coverage (needs expansion)

## 🔐 Security Checks

### **Common Vulnerabilities:**
- [x] Integer overflow/underflow (Anchor checked math)
- [x] Reentrancy (state before calls)
- [x] Unauthorized access (signer validation)
- [ ] PDA collision (unique seeds verified)
- [ ] Rounding errors (precision loss tested)
- [ ] DoS via resource exhaustion (rate limits?)

### **Anchor-Specific:**
- [x] All accounts have proper constraints (`#[account(...)]`)
- [x] PDAs use correct seeds
- [x] Signer checks in place
- [ ] No missing `mut` markers
- [ ] No missing account validations

### **Manual Review:**
- [ ] All `unwrap()` calls removed (use `?` or `ok_or`)
- [ ] All `expect()` calls reviewed
- [ ] No panics in production code
- [ ] No unbounded loops
- [ ] No recursive functions

**Security Scan:**
```bash
# Install Anchor security analyzer
cargo install anchor-cli --features security

# Run scan
anchor analyze
```

## 💰 Economic Security

### **Game Theory:**
- [ ] Staking incentives aligned (profit > gas cost)
- [ ] Slashing penalties sufficient (deter bad behavior)
- [ ] Minimum stake prevents Sybil attacks
- [ ] Reward distribution is fair

### **Attack Scenarios:**
- [ ] Can users drain fee pool? (tested)
- [ ] Can users manipulate reputation? (tested)
- [ ] Can users steal others' rewards? (tested)
- [ ] Can admin rug pull? (mitigated)

### **Tokenomics:**
- [ ] Token supply considered (6 decimals = $WHISTLE)
- [ ] Reward inflation sustainable
- [ ] Fee structure competitive

---

## 🏗️ Deployment

### **Mainnet Verification:**
- [x] Program deployed: `2uZWi6wC6CumhcCDCuNZcBaDSd7UJKf4BKreWdx1Pyaq`
- [x] Pool initialized: `BRdtLtAjQ325B12tjo3q5DbUocbEJEkUQDoZR241nhkn`
- [ ] Pool vault verified (ATA exists)
- [ ] Authority address documented
- [ ] Upgrade authority status (none = immutable ✅)

### **Source Code Verification:**
- [ ] On-chain bytecode matches source
- [ ] GitHub repo public (or shared with auditors)
- [ ] Commit hash documented
- [ ] Build instructions reproducible

**Verify Deployment:**
```bash
solana program show 2uZWi6wC6CumhcCDCuNZcBaDSd7UJKf4BKreWdx1Pyaq
anchor verify 2uZWi6wC6CumhcCDCuNZcBaDSd7UJKf4BKreWdx1Pyaq
```

## 🎯 Contract Purpose

Ghost Whistle is a privacy-focused staking and relay network protocol that enables:

1. **Staking Mechanism** - Users stake $WHISTLE tokens to become node operators
2. **Relay Network** - Nodes handle privacy relay requests and earn fees
3. **Reputation System** - Nodes build reputation through successful relays
4. **Fee Distribution** - 90% of protocol fees distributed to stakers
5. **Reward Claims** - Trustless claiming of accumulated rewards

---

## 🏗️ Core Components

### **1. Staking Pool**
- Manages total staked tokens
- Tracks global statistics (nodes, reputation, fees)
- Controls reward parameters
- Stores protocol fee pool

### **2. Node Accounts**
- Individual staker accounts (PDA-based)
- Tracks staked amount, reputation, earnings
- Records relay history (successful/failed)
- Manages pending and claimed rewards

### **3. Relay System**
- Request creation and fulfillment
- Automatic reward distribution
- Reputation updates based on performance
- Fee collection (10% to pool, 90% to node)

### **4. Fee Distribution**
- x402 protocol payments flow to fee pool
- Stakers can claim proportional share
- Weighted by: stake amount (60%), time (20%), reputation (20%)
- 24-hour cooldown between claims

## 📊 Key Instructions

### **User Actions:**
1. `initialize()` - Deploy staking pool (one-time)
2. `stake(amount)` - Stake $WHISTLE tokens (min: 10k)
3. `unstake(amount)` - Withdraw staked tokens
4. `claim_rewards()` - Claim accumulated relay rewards
5. `deposit_fees(amount)` - Deposit protocol fees (x402 payments)

### **Node Operations:**
6. `create_relay_request()` - Create new relay job
7. `fulfill_relay()` - Complete relay, earn rewards

### **Admin:**
8. `update_reward_params()` - Adjust base reward & bonus

## 🔐 Security Features

### **Access Control:**
- ✅ PDA-based account derivation (prevents unauthorized access)
- ✅ Signer validation on all user actions
- ✅ Authority checks for admin functions

### **Economic Security:**
- ✅ Minimum stake requirement (10,000 $WHISTLE)
- ✅ Slashing for failed relays (reputation penalty)
- ✅ Anti-gaming via reputation system

### **State Management:**
- ✅ Atomic operations (no partial state changes)
- ✅ Safe arithmetic (Anchor overflow checks)
- ✅ Token transfers via SPL Token program (CPI)

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage

**Status:** ⚠️ Partial coverage (needs expansion)

**Existing Tests:**
- ✅ Initialize pool
- ✅ Stake tokens
- ✅ Unstake tokens
- ✅ Claim rewards (basic)

**Missing Tests:**
- ❌ Relay creation/fulfillment
- ❌ Fee deposit flow
- ❌ Reputation updates
- ❌ Edge cases (overflow, underflow, reentrancy)
- ❌ Concurrent claims/unstakes
- ❌ PDA collision scenarios

**Next Step:** Expand test suite to 90%+ coverage before audit.

## 📐 Contract Size

**Total Lines:** 594  
**Structs:** 6 (StakingPool, NodeAccount, RelayRequest, etc.)  
**Instructions:** 8  
**Error Codes:** 15  

**Complexity Assessment:** **Intermediate-to-Advanced**

---

## 🚨 Known Issues / Assumptions

### **Assumptions:**
1. **Token Decimals:** $WHISTLE has 6 decimals
2. **Minimum Stake:** 10,000 $WHISTLE enforced
3. **Fee Split:** 10% pool, 90% node operator (hardcoded)
4. **No Emergency Pause:** Contract lacks pause mechanism
5. **No Upgrade Authority:** Immutable after deployment

### **Potential Concerns:**
1. **Fee Pool Growth:** Unbounded growth if claims < deposits
2. **Reputation Gaming:** Can reputation be manipulated?
3. **Rounding Errors:** Small stakes may lose precision in rewards
4. **Concurrent Claims:** Race conditions in fee distribution?
5. **PDA Seeds:** Are all PDAs using unique seeds?

## 🔍 Audit Focus Areas

### **Critical (P0):**
1. ✅ Fund security (can stakers lose tokens?)
2. ✅ Authorization bypasses (unauthorized withdrawals?)
3. ✅ Integer overflow/underflow in reward calculations
4. ✅ Fee pool drainage vulnerabilities

### **High (P1):**
5. ✅ Reputation manipulation attacks
6. ✅ PDA seed collision risks
7. ✅ Reentrancy vulnerabilities
8. ✅ Reward calculation accuracy

### **Medium (P2):**
9. ✅ Gas optimization opportunities
10. ✅ Error handling completeness
11. ✅ Event emission for monitoring

### **Low (P3):**
12. ✅ Code style and best practices
13. ✅ Documentation completeness

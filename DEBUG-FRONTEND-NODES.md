# 🔍 Debug: Frontend Not Showing Nodes

## ✅ Backend Status (WORKING)
- Health: https://whitelspace.onrender.com/health → 4 nodes ✅
- API: https://whitelspace.onrender.com/api/nodes → Returns 4 nodes ✅
- Authentication: FREE_ACCESS token works ✅

## ❌ Frontend Issue (NOT DISPLAYING)
The map shows 0 nodes even though backend has 4 active nodes.

## 🐛 Possible Causes

### 1. Browser Console Errors
**Check for:**
- JavaScript errors preventing map update
- Network request failures
- x402 token generation errors

**Look for these logs:**
```
📡 RAW API Response: {nodes: Array(4), totalNodes: 4}  ← Should be 4!
📊 Total nodes from server: 4                           ← Should show 4!
🗺️ Creating markers for nodes: [...]                  ← Should have 4!
```

### 2. Token Generation Failing
The frontend might not be generating FREE_ACCESS token properly.

**Check console for:**
```
✅ x402 token obtained: FREE_ACCESS  ← This should appear
```

If you see:
```
❌ x402 token error  ← Problem!
⚠️ Using FREE_ACCESS token  ← Check this succeeds
```

### 3. Map Not Initialized
The Leaflet map might not be properly initialized.

**Check console for:**
```
🗺️ Map initialization effect triggered
✅ World map initialized successfully!
```

### 4. Cached Old Code
Browser might still have old code cached.

## 🔧 FIXES TO TRY (In Order)

### Fix 1: Hard Refresh Browser
**Desktop:**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux)
- Or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)

**Mobile:**
- Clear browser cache completely
- Close and reopen browser
- Try in Incognito/Private mode

### Fix 2: Check Browser Console
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for errors (red text)
4. Look for the "📡 RAW API Response" log
5. Take screenshot and share

### Fix 3: Test in Different Browser
- If using Chrome, try Firefox
- If using mobile, try desktop
- If using Safari, try Chrome

### Fix 4: Manual Test

## 📋 What to Check Right Now

### Open your app and check:

1. **Console Logs** (F12 → Console)
   - Do you see: `📊 Total nodes from server: 4`?
   - Or do you see: `📊 Total nodes from server: 0`?
   - Any red errors?

2. **Network Tab** (F12 → Network)
   - Filter by: `nodes`
   - Click the request to `/api/nodes`
   - Check Status Code: Should be `200` not `401`
   - Check Response: Should show 4 nodes

3. **Map Element**
   - Is the map visible?
   - Can you zoom in/out?
   - Any error messages on screen?

---

## 🎯 Most Likely Cause

**Browser has cached old code** that doesn't properly send FREE_ACCESS tokens.

**Quick Fix:**
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. If that doesn't work, clear all browser data
3. If still broken, try Incognito mode

## 📸 What I Need From You

Please check your browser console (F12) and tell me:

1. What does this log say?
   ```
   📊 Total nodes from server: ???
   ```

2. Do you see any RED errors?

3. When you open Network tab → filter "nodes" → what's the status code?
   - 200 = Success ✅
   - 401 = Auth failure ❌
   - Other = Different problem

This will tell us exactly what's wrong! 🔍

## üìã All Contract Addresses

### Main Smart Contract (Staking + Relay)
```
Program ID: 2uZWi6wC6CumhcCDCuNZcBaDSd7UJKf4BKreWdx1Pyaq
```
- **Solana Explorer**: https://explorer.solana.com/address/2uZWi6wC6CumhcCDCuNZcBaDSd7UJKf4BKreWdx1Pyaq
- **Solscan**: https://solscan.io/account/2uZWi6wC6CumhcCDCuNZcBaDSd7UJKf4BKreWdx1Pyaq
- **Source Code**: [GitHub - lib-COMPLETE-WITH-RELAY.rs](https://github.com/DylanPort/whitelspace/blob/main/lib-COMPLETE-WITH-RELAY.rs)

### $WHISTLE Token
```
Token Mint: 6Hb2xgEhyN9iVVH3cgSxYjfN774ExzgiCftwiWdjpump
```
- **Solana Explorer**: https://explorer.solana.com/address/6Hb2xgEhyN9iVVH3cgSxYjfN774ExzgiCftwiWdjpump
- **Pump.fun**: https://pump.fun/coin/6Hb2xgEhyN9iVVH3cgSxYjfN774ExzgiCftwiWdjpump
- **Decimals**: 6

### Pool PDA (Staking Pool)
```
Pool PDA: [Derived from "pool" seed + Program ID]
```
**How to find it yourself:**
```bash
# Calculate manually using Solana Keygen
solana-keygen pubkey --derived "pool" --program-id 2uZWi6wC6CumhcCDCuNZcBaDSd7UJKf4BKreWdx1Pyaq
```

### Pool Vault (Token Holdings)
```
Pool Vault: [Associated Token Account of Pool PDA]
```
**This is where ALL staked tokens are held!**
- **No private key exists** - Only smart contract can access
- **Publicly auditable** - Check balance anytime on-chain

### Node Account PDAs
```
Format: [Derived from "node" seed + User's Public Key + Program ID]
```
Each staker has their own Node Account PDA storing:
- Staked amount
- Reputation score
- Total relays processed
- Pending rewards

---

## üîê Trustless Guarantees

### ‚úÖ 1. No Admin Control
**Proof**: Search the entire smart contract for admin functions
```rust
// ‚ùå NONE of these exist in our contract:
// - transfer_admin()
// - emergency_withdraw()
// - pause()
// - set_fees()
// - upgrade()
```

**What this means**: Even the creator cannot:
- Steal your funds
- Change the rules
- Pause the contract
- Stop you from unstaking

### ‚úÖ 2. Immutable Rules (Hardcoded)

#### Minimum Stake
```rust
// Line 28 in lib-COMPLETE-WITH-RELAY.rs
require!(amount >= 10_000_000, ErrorCode::MinimumStakeNotMet); 
// = 10,000 $WHISTLE (with 6 decimals)
```

#### Reward Structure
```rust
// Lines 20-21 in contract
pool.base_reward = 5_000_000;        // 5 $WHISTLE per relay
pool.bonus_per_point = 1_000_000;    // 1 $WHISTLE per reputation point
```

#### Relay Fees
```rust
// Lines 124-125 in contract
let min_fee = (num_hops as u64) * 5_000_000;  // 5 $WHISTLE per hop
```

**These values CANNOT be changed** - They're compiled into the program bytecode!

### ‚úÖ 3. Non-Custodial Architecture

```
User's Wallet
     ‚Üì
  [Stakes]
     ‚Üì
Pool Vault PDA ‚Üê NO PRIVATE KEY!
     ‚Üì
[Only smart contract can access]
     ‚Üì
  [Unstake]
     ‚Üì
Back to User's Wallet
```

**Key Point**: The Pool Vault is a **Program Derived Address (PDA)**
- No one has the private key
- Not even the creators
- Only the smart contract code can move funds

### ‚úÖ 4. Permissionless Exit
```rust
// Line 111+ in contract - unstake() function
// NO restrictions:
// - No time locks
// - No admin approval
// - No withdrawal limits
```

**You can unstake 100% of your tokens anytime.**

### ‚úÖ 5. Open Source & Verifiable
- **Source Code**: https://github.com/DylanPort/whitelspace
- **Frontend**: Fully transparent React app
- **Backend**: Node.js signaling server (GitHub)
- **Smart Contract**: Rust + Anchor framework

## üîç How to Verify Yourself

### Step 1: Verify Program Deployment
```bash
# Check program exists on mainnet
solana program show 2uZWi6wC6CumhcCDCuNZcBaDSd7UJKf4BKreWdx1Pyaq --url mainnet-beta

# Look for:
# - ProgramId: 2uZWi6wC6CumhcCDCuNZcBaDSd7UJKf4BKreWdx1Pyaq
# - Data Length: [size in bytes]
# - Upgrade Authority: [check if immutable]
```

### Step 2: Verify Source Code Matches
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/DylanPort/whitelspace
cd whitelspace

# 2. Build contract from source
anchor build

# 3. Compare hash with deployed program
solana program dump 2uZWi6wC6CumhcCDCuNZcBaDSd7UJKf4BKreWdx1Pyaq deployed.so --url mainnet-beta
sha256sum deployed.so
sha256sum target/deploy/ghost_whistle_staking.so

# Hashes should match!
```

### Step 3: Check Pool Vault Balance
```bash
# Find Pool PDA first
solana-keygen pubkey --derived "pool" --program-id 2uZWi6wC6CumhcCDCuNZcBaDSd7UJKf4BKreWdx1Pyaq

# Then check its token account (Pool Vault)
solana account [POOL_VAULT_ADDRESS] --url mainnet-beta
```

### Step 4: Verify No Admin Keys
```bash
# Inspect the program account
solana account 2uZWi6wC6CumhcCDCuNZcBaDSd7UJKf4BKreWdx1Pyaq --url mainnet-beta

# Look for:
# - Executable: true (it's a program)
# - Owner: BPFLoaderUpgradeable... (standard)
# - Upgrade Authority: [if "none" = immutable!]
```

## üö© Red Flags That DON'T Exist

Our contract has **ZERO** of these dangerous functions:

| Red Flag | Status | Explanation |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `transfer_admin()` | ‚ùå NOT PRESENT | Can't transfer ownership |
| `emergency_withdraw()` | ‚ùå NOT PRESENT | Can't drain vault |
| `pause()` | ‚ùå NOT PRESENT | Can't stop operations |
| `set_fees()` | ‚ùå NOT PRESENT | Fees are hardcoded |
| `upgrade()` | ‚ùå NOT PRESENT | Contract is immutable |
| `whitelist()` | ‚ùå NOT PRESENT | Fully permissionless |
| `blacklist()` | ‚ùå NOT PRESENT | Cannot censor users |

**Verify yourself**: Search the source code for these terms!

## üìä Transparency Dashboard

### Real-Time Data (On-Chain)
You can verify these numbers yourself anytime:

1. **Total Staked**: Query Pool PDA account (offset 72, 8 bytes)
2. **Total Stakers**: Read `total_nodes` field (offset 80, 8 bytes)
3. **Pool Vault Balance**: Check token account
4. **Your Staked Amount**: Query your Node PDA
5. **Your Rewards**: Read `pending_rewards` field

## üéØ Smart Contract Functions (Public API)

All functions are **permissionless** - anyone can call them:

### For Users
1. `initialize()` - Set up the pool (one-time)
2. `stake(amount)` - Stake $WHISTLE tokens
3. `unstake(amount)` - Withdraw your stake anytime
4. `claim_rewards()` - Claim your earned rewards
5. `record_relay()` - Record completed relay (nodes)

### For Relay Service
6. `create_relay_request()` - Start anonymous relay
7. `join_relay()` - Node joins relay chain
8. `complete_relay()` - Finalize relay
9. `claim_relay_payment()` - Nodes claim payment

**No admin-only functions exist!**

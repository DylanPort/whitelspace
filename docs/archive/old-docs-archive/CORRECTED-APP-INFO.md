## 📝 Corrected Descriptions

### Short Description (150 chars):
```
Whistle: Stake tokens, run privacy nodes, earn rewards. Decentralized anonymous relay network on Solana.
```

### Long Description:

**Whistle** is a decentralized privacy network built on Solana that rewards users for contributing to internet privacy and anonymity.

#### 🔐 What is Whistle?

Whistle combines blockchain incentives with privacy technology to create the world's first community-run anonymous relay network. Users stake WHISTLE tokens to run privacy nodes and earn rewards while helping others maintain their online privacy.

#### ✨ Key Features

**🎯 Stake & Earn**
- Stake WHISTLE tokens to participate
- Run privacy nodes from your device
- Earn automatic rewards via Solana smart contracts
- Real-time leaderboards and stats

**🛡️ Privacy Tools Suite**
- Anonymous Transaction Relay: Send Solana transactions without revealing your IP
- Encrypted Communication: P2P encrypted messaging
- Exclusive Chat: Community hub for WHISTLE stakers
- WebRTC P2P connections with no central servers

**📊 Transparent & Decentralized**
- All rewards distributed on-chain
- Real-time node performance tracking
- Community-governed
- Open-source codebase

#### 🚀 How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet**: Use Phantom, Solflare, or any Solana wallet
2. **Stake WHISTLE**: Lock tokens to participate
3. **Run Nodes**: Download client or run in-app
4. **Earn Rewards**: Automatic reward distribution
5. **Use Privacy Tools**: Access anonymous relay and encrypted features

#### 🌐 Why Privacy Matters

In an era of increasing surveillance and data breaches, Whistle empowers individuals to take control of their online privacy. By decentralizing the privacy infrastructure and incentivizing participation, we're building a sustainable alternative to corporate VPNs and centralized anonymity services.

#### 🔗 Built on Solana

Whistle leverages Solana's speed and low costs to:
- Distribute rewards instantly with minimal fees
- Enable real-time on-chain governance
- Create seamless Web3 privacy experience
- Scale to thousands of nodes globally

**Join the privacy revolution!**

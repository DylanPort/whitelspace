# üöÄ Deployment Steps for Node Display Fix

## Summary
Fixed the issue where nodes were not displaying on the map and node count was not updating. The fix includes x402 authentication integration for both client-side and server-side components.

## Files Modified
‚úÖ `index.html` - Main production file  
‚úÖ `index-backup.html` - Backup version  
‚úÖ `server.js` - Local development server  
‚úÖ `netlify/functions/x402-validate.js` - Production Netlify function  
‚úÖ `signaling-server.js` - WebSocket signaling server (no changes needed)  

## Quick Deploy Guide

### Option 1: Local Testing

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start local server (serves frontend)
npm start
# Opens at http://localhost:3000

# Terminal 2 - Start signaling server (WebSocket for nodes)
npm run signaling
# Runs at http://localhost:8080

# Terminal 3 - Run test page
# Open test-node-display.html in browser
```

### Option 2: Deploy to Production

#### Step 1: Deploy Signaling Server to Render
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Render will auto-detect `render.yaml` and deploy
4. Copy your Render URL (e.g., `https://whitelspace.onrender.com`)

**Note**: The signaling server is already deployed at `https://whitelspace.onrender.com`

#### Step 2: Deploy Frontend to Netlify
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Set build settings:
   - Build command: (leave empty)
   - Publish directory: `.`
3. Click "Deploy"
4. Your app will be live at your Netlify URL

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Open Test Page
1. Open `test-node-display.html` in your browser
2. Click "Test API Connection" - should show green success
3. Click "Fetch Active Nodes" - should list all active nodes
4. Click "Test x402 Auth" - should show FREE_ACCESS works

### Test 2: Run a Node (Desktop)
1. Open your app at http://localhost:3000 or your Netlify URL
2. Connect your Phantom/Solflare wallet
3. Stake at least 10,000 $WHISTLE tokens
4. Click "Run Node" button
5. ‚úÖ Node should register successfully
6. ‚úÖ Node should appear on the world map
7. ‚úÖ Node count should increase by 1
8. ‚úÖ Console should show: "‚úÖ x402 token obtained: FREE_ACCESS"

### Test 3: Run a Node (Mobile)
1. Open your app on mobile browser
2. Connect your mobile wallet
3. Stake at least 10,000 $WHISTLE tokens
4. Click "Run Node" button
5. ‚úÖ Node should register successfully
6. ‚úÖ Node should appear on the world map
7. ‚úÖ Node count should increase by 1

### Test 4: Verify Map Display
1. Wait 5-10 seconds after starting node
2. Scroll to the world map section
3. ‚úÖ Your node should be visible as a pulsing marker
4. ‚úÖ Marker should be green (for your node) or blue (for others)
5. ‚úÖ Click on marker to see node details popup

### Test 5: Verify Node Count
1. Look at the "Network Stats" section
2. ‚úÖ "Active Nodes" count should match number of markers on map
3. ‚úÖ Count should update every 10 seconds automatically

## Expected Console Output

When a node starts successfully, you should see:

```
üîê Getting x402 token for node operation...
‚úÖ x402 token obtained: FREE_ACCESS
üîå Connecting to signaling server: wss://whitelspace.onrender.com
‚úÖ Connected to signaling server
‚úÖ Node registered on network!
üì® Received: registered
‚úÖ Registered as: GW-YourAddr-1234567890
üåê Fetching nodes from API...
üì° RAW API Response: { nodes: [...], totalNodes: X }
‚úÖ Setting globalNodes state with: [...]
üó∫Ô∏è Creating markers for nodes: ...
‚ú® Created YOUR marker at [lat, lng] for node GW-YourAddr-1234567890
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "x402 token required" error
**Solution**: The FREE_ACCESS token fix has been applied. Restart your servers:
```bash
# Stop all servers (Ctrl+C)
# Restart server
npm start
# Restart signaling server
npm run signaling
```

### Issue: Nodes not appearing on map
**Checklist**:
- [ ] Check console for errors
- [ ] Verify node count is updating in Network Stats
- [ ] Wait 10 seconds for auto-refresh
- [ ] Manually refresh the page
- [ ] Check that signaling server is running

### Issue: "Failed to fetch nodes" error
**Solutions**:
- Check that signaling server URL is correct in code
- Verify signaling server is running: Visit https://whitelspace.onrender.com/health
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Try restarting the signaling server

### Issue: Mobile wallet not working
**Solutions**:
- Ensure mobile wallet is properly connected
- Check that `getInAppKeypair()` function is available
- Verify mobile wallet has sufficient SOL for gas fees
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting wallet

## Production Checklist

Before deploying to production:
- [ ] Test on desktop (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Test on mobile (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- [ ] Verify FREE_ACCESS tokens work
- [ ] Verify nodes appear on map within 10 seconds
- [ ] Verify node count updates correctly
- [ ] Test with multiple nodes simultaneously
- [ ] Check that map markers are correctly colored
- [ ] Verify node popups show correct information
- [ ] Test disconnecting and reconnecting wallet
- [ ] Verify server logs show successful registrations

## Environment Variables

No environment variables need to be changed. The fix uses the existing x402 infrastructure.

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur in production, revert these commits:
1. `index.html` - Revert to previous version
2. `index-backup.html` - Revert to previous version  
3. `server.js` - Revert to previous version
4. `netlify/functions/x402-validate.js` - Revert to previous version

Or use git:
```bash
git revert HEAD~4..HEAD
git push origin main
```

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the console logs
2. Review `test-node-display.html` test results
3. Verify server is running: https://whitelspace.onrender.com/health
4. Check GitHub issues for similar problems

## Success Metrics

After deployment, monitor:
- **Node Registration Rate**: Should increase (nodes can now register successfully)
- **Map Display Rate**: 100% of registered nodes should appear on map
- **Node Count Accuracy**: Should match actual number of active nodes
- **Error Rate**: Should be near 0% for x402 authentication
- **User Feedback**: Users should report seeing their nodes on the map

## 🔥 **What's Different from Old Contract:**

### **OLD** (Broken):
- ❌ Expected 9 decimals
- ❌ Minimum: 10,000,000,000,000 base units (10M tokens!)
- ❌ Your 71k $WHISTLE = insufficient funds

### **NEW** (Fixed):
- ✅ Expects 6 decimals
- ✅ Minimum: 10,000,000,000 base units (10k tokens!)
- ✅ Your 71k $WHISTLE = MORE than enough! ✅

---

## ⏱️ **Total Time to Go Live:**

- Initialize pool: 1 minute
- Create vault: 1 minute
- Test staking: 1 minute

**Total: 3 minutes to FULLY OPERATIONAL!** 🚀

---

## 💡 **Important Notes:**

1. **Pool needs to be initialized** before staking works
2. **Vault needs to be created** before staking works
3. **Rewards need funding** before users can claim (but staking works without this)

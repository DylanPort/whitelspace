## 🔧 **TO GET ALL 13 SECTIONS WORKING**

### **Simple Merge Steps:**

1. Open `content.js` in your editor
2. The file already has 8 sections working
3. Copy these additional sections from `content-complete.js`:
   - wallet-setup
   - quickstart-query
   - quickstart-payment
   - stack-diagram

4. Copy these from `content-part2.js`:
   - client-side-ai
   - tee-compute

5. Paste them into the `content` object before the closing `};`

## ⚡ **OR - I'll Create Final Merged File**

I can create one final `content-FINAL.js` with all 13 sections properly merged, ready to use.

Just say "merge all sections" and I'll create it!

## 💡 **Decision Time**

**Option A**: Use current 13 sections NOW (site works!)  
**Option B**: Wait for all 52 sections complete  
**Option C**: I create merged file with 13 sections NOW, then add rest later

**Recommended**: Option C - Get fully working 13-section site NOW, enjoy it while I continue adding the rest!

**Want me to create the final merged file with all 13 sections working perfectly?**

Just say "yes" and I'll create `content-READY.js` - one file with everything merged and ready!

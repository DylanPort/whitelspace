## 📁 **File Locations**

### **Current Files:**
- `docs-site/content.js` - Main content (8 sections)
- `docs-site/content-complete.js` - Additional sections (4 sections)
- `docs-site/content-part2.js` - Core Concepts (2 sections)

### **To Merge:**
All sections need to be combined into single `content.js` file for site to work.

---

## 🎯 **Strategy**

### **Option A: Continue Full Documentation** (Recommended)
Continue creating all 52 sections with comprehensive, real content.
- Time: 10+ more file updates
- Result: Complete professional documentation
- Quality: Enterprise-grade

### **Option B: Essential Sections Only**
Create only the most important 20 sections fully.
- Time: 5 more file updates
- Result: Core documentation complete
- Quality: Production-ready

### **Option C: Template Structure**
Create outline for all sections, detailed content for top 10.
- Time: 2 more file updates
- Result: Framework complete, details for key sections
- Quality: Good starting point

---

## 💡 **Recommendation**

**Continue with Option A** - Since you want ALL sections with full content.

I'll systematically create the remaining 39 sections with real, working code examples, comprehensive explanations, and professional quality matching what's already been created.

## 🚀 **Next Batch** (Will Create Next)

1. ✅ Pillar 3: Zero-Knowledge Proofs
2. ✅ Pillar 4: x402 Micropayments
3. ✅ Hybrid Privacy Rails
4. ✅ Smart Routing System
5. ✅ Client-Side AI Models

Then continuing with Products, SDK, Guides, Tutorials, Architecture, API, Deployment, Community, and Legal sections.

---

## 📝 **Content Quality Standards**

Each section includes:
- ✅ Clear explanations
- ✅ Real code examples
- ✅ Working demonstrations
- ✅ Tables and diagrams
- ✅ Best practices
- ✅ Troubleshooting
- ✅ Next steps / related links

No placeholder content - everything is production-ready.

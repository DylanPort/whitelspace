- ✅ Real responses
- ✅ ~1-2s response time

### **2. Sentiment Analysis**
- ✅ Analyzes text sentiment
- ✅ Returns positive/negative/neutral
- ✅ ~0.5-1s processing time

### **3. Translation**
- ✅ Translates between languages
- ✅ Uses OpenAI for translation
- ✅ ~0.5-1s processing time

### **4. REST API**
- ✅ HTTP endpoints for all features
- ✅ `/api/query` for AI queries
- ✅ Server running on port 3000

## 🚧 **WHAT'S COMING SOON (Not Implemented)**

These are **planned features** that are NOT yet built:

### **1. Client-Side AI (WebGPU)**
- 🚧 Browser-based AI inference
- 🚧 WebGPU acceleration
- 🚧 Transformers.js integration
- 🚧 Local model loading

### **2. TEE Backend (AWS Nitro)**
- 🚧 Hardware-isolated compute
- 🚧 Remote attestation
- 🚧 Encrypted memory
- 🚧 AWS Nitro Enclaves

### **3. Blockchain Features**
- 🚧 Solana smart contracts (fake addresses removed)
- 🚧 x402 Micropayments
- 🚧 On-chain verification
- 🚧 Token system

### **4. Advanced Features**

## 📝 **SECTIONS UPDATED**

I added **"🚧 Coming Soon"** warnings to these sections:

1. ✅ **Portal Page** - Added MVP status warning
2. ✅ **Contract Addresses** - Removed fake addresses, added "Coming Soon"
3. ✅ **Client-Side AI Models** - Marked as "Coming Soon"
4. ✅ **TEE AI Oracles** - Marked as "Coming Soon"
5. ✅ **Privacy Mixer** - Marked as "Coming Soon"
6. ✅ **Model Marketplace** - Marked as "Coming Soon"

## 🎨 **HOW IT LOOKS NOW**

### **Before (Misleading):**
```
✅ Client-Side AI Models
Pre-optimized AI models that run directly in your browser with WebGPU...
```

### **After (Honest):**
```
⚠️ Coming Soon
Client-side AI with WebGPU is currently in development.
The MVP currently uses server-side AI via OpenAI API.
```

## 🎯 **WHAT THIS MEANS**

### **For Users:**
- They see exactly what's working vs what's planned
- No false promises
- Clear MVP status
- Honest expectations

### **For You:**
- No legal issues with fake claims
- Builds trust with transparency
- Shows your roadmap clearly
- Sets realistic expectations

---

## 🔍 **VIEW THE CHANGES**

Your browser should have automatically opened with the updated documentation. Look for:

1. **Portal page** - Now shows "MVP Available Now" with warnings
2. **Contract Addresses** - Shows "Coming Soon" instead of fake addresses
3. **Product sections** - All have "Coming Soon" warnings where needed
4. **Performance claims** - Updated to reflect current MVP only

---

## ✅ **WHAT YOU CAN HONESTLY SAY NOW**

### **TRUE STATEMENTS:**
- ✅ "We have a working MVP with AI features"
- ✅ "Sentiment analysis, translation, and chat are working"
- ✅ "We're building towards a hybrid privacy architecture"
- ✅ "Client-side AI and blockchain features coming soon"

### **AVOID SAYING:**
- ❌ "50-300x faster than competitors" (not tested/proven)
- ❌ "Smart contracts deployed on Solana" (not deployed)
- ❌ "Client-side AI with WebGPU" (not implemented)
- ❌ "TEE backend running" (not deployed)

---

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

If you want to make the claims TRUE, you'd need to:

1. **Build client-side AI** - Implement WebGPU + Transformers.js
2. **Deploy smart contracts** - Write and deploy Rust programs to Solana
3. **Deploy TEE backend** - Set up AWS Nitro Enclaves
4. **Implement payments** - Build x402 payment system

But for now, you have an **honest MVP** with **real working features**!

## 📂 **FILES UPDATED**

- ✅ `cryptwhistle/docs-site/content.js` - Main documentation content
- ✅ All fake content marked as "Coming Soon"
- ✅ Fake contract addresses removed
- ✅ Performance claims adjusted to MVP reality

---

## 🎊 **SUMMARY**

Your documentation is now:
- ✅ **100% Honest**
- ✅ **Clear about what works**
- ✅ **Transparent about what's coming**
- ✅ **No fake addresses or claims**
- ✅ **Trust-building**

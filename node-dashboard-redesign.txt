Due to the complexity and size of the current node dashboard section (lines 10568-10790+), 
I recommend creating a focused, modern redesign that combines all metrics into clean, 
premium dark-themed containers as requested by the user.

The user wants:
1. Modern dark premium theme (not exactly terminal, but inspired)
2. Separate containers within ONE single container
3. All the same metrics but with better visual hierarchy
4. Premium glassmorphic effects

Key sections to include:
- Node Operational Status
- Session Uptime + Broadcasting Location
- Quick Metrics Grid (Node ID, Peers, Relays, Success Rate)
- Performance Metrics (detailed)
- Node Status & Reputation
- Earning Rate
- Connected Peers
- Network Health

All within one unified dark container with modern styling.
